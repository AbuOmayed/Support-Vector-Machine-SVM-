<h3>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h3><br>

This repository contains an implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

<h3>Overview</h3><br>
Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. It works by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is versatile due to its different kernel functions, allowing it to adapt to various data distributions.

<h3>Features</h3><br>
1. Implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.<br>
2. Supports both linear and non-linear classification.<br>
3. Easily extendable for regression tasks.<br>
4. Includes comprehensive documentation and examples.<br>
